Having completed Codecademy's CS101 section 1, this will be my first attempt at an individule Python Terminal Game.

It will be single-player based.  Player will not be able to take a loan if their wallet drops to or below 0.

## Project Steps

1. Create Player Profile
2. Create Deck of Cards
3. Create Wallet to hold player money
4. Greet Player and ask for name
5. Ask player to bet, add to bet
6. Deal to player and comp (hide comp until player stands)
7. Ask player to hit or stand
8. Annouce winner - If player wins add bet to their wallet
9. Ask player if they want to play again
